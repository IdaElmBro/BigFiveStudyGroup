Introduktion (Maria):
evt:
- Stroop task
- emotional valence ..

Aim (Sabrina):
-  investigate the effect of emotions on attention and cognitive processing
- the mouse tracking component of this study may be used to further investigate how emotional information is processed by looking at patterns of movement and reaction time

Exp. Setup (Sara):
- no practice trials,
- neutral and strong valence words (context), randomized
- color is the same in the same position

Results (Ida):
- P-value RT = 0.167
- Smaller effect size
- P-value MAD-time = 0.031
- Medium effect size
- Just by observing trajectories on graph, we can see many extreme trajectories for negative words.

Perspective (Freddy):
- Randomize colors
- Account for lexical similarities/dissimilarities
- Longer initiation periods before each trial
- Longer pauses inbetween the trial/ active transition to the next trial
